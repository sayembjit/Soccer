## Project Overview

This project showcases the design of a relational database to manage information related to football clubs, players, and matches. It demonstrates how to create and use tables for storing data, establish foreign key relationships, and perform SQL queries to retrieve relevant information.

## Database Schema

The project's database schema consists of three main tables:

1. **Clubs Table**: Stores information about football clubs.
   - club_id (Primary Key)
   - club_name
   - club_city

2. **Players Table**: Contains details about players and their club affiliations.
   - player_id (Primary Key)
   - first_name
   - last_name
   - position
   - nationality
   - club_id (Foreign Key referencing Clubs table)

3. **Matches Table**: Holds data about football matches, including teams and scores.
   - match_id (Primary Key)
   - date
   - stadium
   - home_team_id (Foreign Key referencing Clubs table)
   - away_team_id (Foreign Key referencing Clubs table)
   - home_team_score
   - away_team_score

## Getting Started

1. Set up a MySQL database and create the necessary tables using the SQL code provided in the "Database Schema" section.

2. Configure your MySQL database connection parameters (URL, username, password) in the JDBC code examples provided in the repository.

3. Run the provided Java programs to see how to interact with the database using JDBC.

## Usage

- Use the SQL queries to extract specific information from the database, such as player details in a match or match details for a club.

- Review the JDBC code examples to understand how to establish a connection to the database and execute SQL queries using Java.
